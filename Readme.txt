Description: Algorithm development using AI-ML techniques to distinguish vehicular 
movement on highway and service road. Challenge: The algorithm shall be able to 
distinguish the vehicle movement on highway or service road even if intermittent 
GNSS position is not available or large bias is observed in GNSS coordinates. 

Usage: To support the applications such as GNSS-based tolling 

Users: Vehicles moving on highways 

Outcome: The developed algorithm shall provide the following:
1. Use the coarse GNSS position of the moving vehicle and plot the movement on a map 
2. Using map-matching techniques, identify the movement of vehicle on the highway or the service road 
3. Apply AI-ML techniques to improvement map-matching performance.
